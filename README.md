# Student Service
A small web service for students and professors written in Python using the Django framework with MySQL.

## Overview 
This service is a representation of what a real world student service used by universities might look like. It is intended to help students and professors by offering some basic role dependant functionalities, such as managing class schedules, exam schedules, bulletin posts, sending news to groups of students via Email (Gmail API), managing profiles etc.
